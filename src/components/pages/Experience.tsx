				At first i was doing local freelance jobs. As soon as I became 18 years
				old I registered on freelance websites (Fiverr, UpWork) and actively
				started working on serious work and open-source projects. On 2022
				February I started working at the Impel (PulsarAI) as a full-stack
				developer. I had few start-ups and still working on new ideas with my
				friends and family.
